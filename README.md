# RustBot
This project is for building and hosting a Discord bot to gain further understanding about all technologies involved (Discord, Rust+, node.js, etc). After configuring and deploying this simple bot made for the online game Rust, more complicated bots will be created. Thanks, www.openode.io for hosting.
